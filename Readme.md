# Repo for Preauth-io Challenge :D

## Game_01 (Python)

game_01.py file is inside the root folder (I used pytest to run the tests - game_01_tests.py -)

## Game02 (Refactor TypeScritp code)

The code is inside the "game02" folder. I made some little tests that run with the command "npm run test".

P.S. The challenge was exciting, better than building a small API. I had a lovely time doing it.
